Signed on 2015.07.28. 07:12 by Cicada 3301 (845145127) (Key ID: 0x7A35090F).

Spaces: `5 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 7`

Counting the two spaces inbetween the two sentences and one space at the end of that same line, the sequence becomes `5321257`.

Alternatively, we can consider the number `3301` as part of the sequence: `53212330157`.

* Q: Can spaces be added after the signature?
